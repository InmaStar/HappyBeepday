# HappyBeepday

*Program is in Spanish*
  
Initially an exercise for multithreading and producing sounds at low level abstraction.   
It is a tiny console program written in C# that tells the user "Happy Birthday!".  
It asks the user for his/her age. Then it displays something like "Feliz cumplea√±os" many times with different colors. Multuthreading is used for that purpose.  
After that it plays the "Happy Birthday". Actually it uses some kernel function to produce a "beep" acording to the frecuency of some musical note and its duration.
